## Calculate the Probability in a Continuous Distribution assuming the period is between 0 and 30


# Import uniform from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import uniform

# Calculate probability of waiting 10-20 mins
prob_between_10_and_20 = uniform.cdf(20, 0, 30) - uniform.cdf(10, 0, 30)
print(prob_between_10_and_20)
