# How to randomly sample

without replacement
```
df.sample(n) # where n is the number of smaples
```

with sampling
```
df.sample(n, replace = True)
```

if we want to be able to reproduce the output, we set a seed first

```
np.random.seed(10)
```

To generate continuous distribution, for interval between 0 and 30, 1000 samples
```
np.random.seed(seed=334)
from scipy.stats import uniform
uniform.rvs(0, 30, size=1000)
```

# Binomial Distribution

```
from scipy.stats import binom
```

one flip, 8 times
```
binom.rvs(1, 0.5, size=8
```

8 flips, one time
```
binom.rvs(8, 0.5, size=1)
```

Prob getting exacltly 7 heads in 10 attmepts:
```
# binom.pmf(num heads, num trials, prob of heads)  
binom.pmf(7, 10, 0.5)
```

Prob getting <=7 heads in 10 attempts with a fair coin
```
binom.cdf(7, 10, 0.5)
```
