# How to randomly sample

without replacement
```
df.sample(n) # where n is the number of smaples
```

with sampling
```
df.sample(n, replace = True)
```

if we want to be able to reproduce the output, we set a seed first

```
np.random.seed(10)
```

To generate continuous distribution, for interval between 0 and 30, 1000 samples
```
np.random.seed(seed=334)
from scipy.stats import uniform
uniform.rvs(0, 30, size=1000)
```
